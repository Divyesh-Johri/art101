            <h2>iPhones Sell Ideologies</h2>
            <p>
                Persuasion is an art that nearly everyone practices. The core cause of
                all rhetoric and argument is to persuade an opposing party. This
                cannot be done without appealing or acknowledging the commonplaces and
                ideologies that those of the opposing party may hold. 
                <br /><br />
                While many people are opinionated and are not afraid to voice their ideas and
                beliefs for all to hear and see, such methods typically end in
                conflict with others, resonating amongst those who hold the same
                ideologies but widening the void with those who do not. This sort of
                argument is most commonly seen in today’s social and political
                struggles, perhaps the first type of debate thought of when mentioning
                the term 'argument'. 
                <br /><br />
                However, there is another form of persuasion
                which is more relevant to today’s world than politics and social
                movements: advertisements. Selling products is by far the most common
                practice of persuasion, one could not walk down a single street
                without viewing an advertisement of some sort arguing for its product
                or service. In fact, advertisements have become so commonplace that
                people subconsciously adopt the arguments they present.
            </p>
            <h3>Impact of Advertisements</h3>
            <p>
                For instance, if an ad on TV claims that Mucinex is the superior brand
                of cough syrup due to whatever comical or statistical reasoning it
                gives, most may pay no attention to it. That is, until they are sick
                and decide to purchase some over-the-counter relief, which is when
                they see the Mucinex bottle and recognize it as at least “good”. Of
                course, they may not actually buy it, but they end up comparing their
                chosen product with Mucinex to see which is better. Subconsciously,
                even if Mucinex failed in selling its product, it succeeded in setting
                its product as the standard for the viewers’ purchase. Their
                commonplace on cough syrup changed to “Mucinex is a good standard for
                comparison”. 
                <br /><br />
                Similarly, companies like Apple have been practicing
                persuasion for over a decade, and unlike the theoretical case with
                Mucinex, Apple has been incredibly successful. By now, it seems clear
                that the creators of products and its advertisements have impacted
                society’s ideologies and commonplaces in some way, subconsciously or
                not. It is this art that Apple has perfected repeatedly with each of
                their iPhones, masterfully demonstrated in the 'Introducing
                iPhone 11’ ad, which utilizes a structure that connects with the
                audience, demonstrates a feature set which blows them away, and
                ultimately reflects upon why Apple is such a successful brand today.
            </p>
            <h3>Targeted Ad Structure</h3>
            <p>
                The iPhone 11 ad structure manages to connect with the audience and
                present exactly what this new phone could do in their daily lives.
                People carry their phones with them everywhere they go; almost no
                exception, it is a lifeline that connects people to society. If
                people’s phones were to fail on them in the middle of the day, it
                would seriously hamper their productivity and social networking,
                leaving them ignorant to all that is happening around them (in a
                global sense). 
                <br><br>
                Apple’s iPhone 11 ad acknowledges this ideology behind
                the lifeline that is the smartphone and presents a scenario of a day
                in which the iPhone is always ready to support the user, or as the ad
                puts it, “Ready for action”. The phone is shown to wake the user<sup>1</sup>,
                fall off car seats and tables without a scratch, jostle in a purse,
                become the victim of spills, and still end the day with battery to
                spare. Such reliability is a crave amongst smartphone users, a
                fulfillment of the ideology for a strong connection to today’s global
                society that some mock older generations of phones for failing to
                realize<sup>2</sup> (mostly due to their poor battery life or lack of
                resistance). 
                <br><br>
                Thus, Apple assures its audience that the product it is
                selling is one that holds the same ideology for day-long reliability
                and that those who buy its phone will fulfill it.
            </p>
            <h3>Targeted Features and Presentation</h3>
            <p>
                Along with structuring its ad strategically, Apple made sure the new
                features of its phone would tie in with the everyday lives of those
                watching it, introducing new commonplaces for what a phone should have
                to be useful to those who buy it. These new features, including dual
                cameras and ultrawide photos, “slofies”, faster Face ID, the “fastest
                chip in a smartphone”, “night mode”, as well as many others are
                blended into people’s days in integral ways throughout the ad. 
                <br><br>
                As mentioned before, Apple reinforces the ideology for a reliable
                lifeline by presenting the superior resistance and battery life of the
                iPhone. What Apple also does is create completely new commonplaces and
                connect them to this ideology of the ultimate lifeline, all through
                the presentation of the phone’s new features. 
                <br><br>
                In the same way it
                praised its telephoto lens in the iPhone 7 as a tool of master photo
                creation, Apple hails the ultrawide lens in the iPhone 11, depicting
                it as an element every phone should have due to its usefulness in
                impromptu scenarios, like taking photos of a child in a grocery store. 
                The ad also presents the idea of “slofies”, or slow-motion selfie videos,
                in the same way, coining the term specifically to relate to the
                selfie-obsessed generation known for their colloquial style. 
                <br><br>
                A faster FaceID allows people to access their phones in inconvenient positions,
                the use of the fastest processor (the A13 Bionic) results in
                undisturbed gaming, and “night mode” enables users to capture moments
                in dark environments, all reinforcing the ideology of reliability in a
                phone and adding respective features as commonplaces or standards that
                every phone should have.
            </p>
            <h3>Selling Ideologies and Commonplaces</h3>
            <p>
                From one look at the advertisement, it’s no wonder Apple has record
                sales on every iPhone release and maintains such a loyal consumer base
                despite the growing competition from Android phones. Apple is not a
                company that sells products, it is a company that masters the idea of
                selling commonplaces and ideologies. 
                <br><br>
                From the start, the first iPhone
                revolutionized the way people view a phone, with the later
                introduction of the App Store changing the way people use one (Pierce
                and Goode). Many products try to accomplish what Apple has done, but
                the loyalty of their consumer base who more than ten years ago bought
                into the iPhone’s revolutionary ideology is stronger than any other.
                <br><br>
                Whenever a new iPhone is released, whether it really is revolutionary
                or just evolutionary, Apple ensures two things: the consumer’s
                ideology of the perfect phone (or lifeline) will be met, and the
                features of the new phone will introduce uses of a smartphone that
                sets the standard for all others. This is the case of Mucinex but
                raised to a much greater degree. 
                <br><br>
                Author and organizational consultant
                Simon Sinek best described it with his theory of the Golden Circle: he
                asserted that successful companies focus on why they exist and why
                others should care about them, before launching into how they build
                their product and what they sell (Sinek). Apple sells its beliefs, its
                ideologies and commonplaces, before its products. It is this alluring
                factor that not just subconsciously, but notably alters the ideologies
                of society: for consumers, competitors, and everyone in between. 
                <br><br>
                The iPhone 11 ad is only one of countless ventures towards this result
                that Apple has made throughout its existence.
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Ultimately, whether people really own their ideologies or simply copy
                ones that companies instill through their products and advertisements
                is difficult to say. iPhones are only the beginning, almost every
                product influences people, from technology to medicine to even chairs.
                <br><br>
                Yes, the evolution of the office chairs people work on every day have
                influenced society’s ideology of them, all a result from the ways in
                which designers chose to create and sell them. 
                <br><br>
                Whether those who are
                passionate about their beliefs are willing to accept this truth is
                meaningless in the eyes of those who profit from the aftermath, the
                companies like Apple who manipulate the commonplaces of the world to
                fill their coffers. No matter what opinion either side of a political
                or social movement may have, it isn’t much of a stretch to say that
                both sides purchase and carry a reliable lifeline to society known as
                the iPhone.

                    The ringtone played in the advertisement aids in capturing the
                    audience’s attention as it is a default alarm that many people may
                    have set themselves.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Older iPhones, such as the iPhone 6 and 6s, have experienced
                    controversies related to dropping battery quality as a result of
                    age. Thus, many consumers who own these phones hold battery life
                    highly amongst their list of needs for a reliable smartphone.
