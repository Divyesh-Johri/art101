                <h3>Beam me up, Scotty</h3>                
                <p>
                    Welcome all to my first blog! For those of you wondering the kind of content this page could have, by 
                    the end, this post will give a good clue! 
                    <img class='leftImg' style='max-width: 10em; padding: .3em 1em .3em' 
                    src='../images/startrek.png' alt='Star Trek'>              
                    <br><br>Ok ok, so, imagine this. Teleportation has just been invented. It copies the form of                    
                    Star Trek, in which bodies are dematerialized and reconstructed through                    
                    <a href='https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a25699/how-quantum-teleportation-works/' target='_blank'>quantum entanglement</a>.
                    Basically, your body is copied, destroyed, and recreated at a molecular level in the location 
                    you wished to teleport to. How cool is that? I’m sure you’re very excited that some random blog 
                    on the internet has just told you teleportation exists with a page from Popular Mechanics as proof.
                    This is only theoretical, ok.                    
                    <br><br>But, while this sounds all sweet and amazing, there’s something that’s been in the back of 
                    my mind since it arrived in a conversation with a few of my friends. Is the teleported you actually 
                    you? I mean, think about it. Essentially, you are dying and being cloned. Your atoms are copied to the 
                    new location. Hell, even if your atoms are transported you are being dematerialized, so you’re still dying. 
                    So is the person that has just been recreated you or your clone that has the same memory and personality as you?
                    <br><br>This questions the theory behind the existence of a soul and the centuries-long argument 
                    of mind-body dualism. Do you believe that your body is purely physical? Is your mind, or soul, 
                    separate from the confines of your body? It’s something that’s been on my mind for a while, and 
                    I honestly can’t tell. You need your body to live. Your mind is physical, it’s real, it can be 
                    affected physically. What happens to it can change your personality and your thoughts. But how can 
                    I look at a clone and honestly say that it’s me? I’m not sure if I’m willing to say that when Scotty 
                    beams me up, I’m the one that’s traveling.</p>

                <h3>The End of the World</h3>                
                <p>
                    How would you want the world to end? I’m definitely not bringing this up because of mass panic over some 
                    disease that sounds like STUPID-19 (haha gottem). Legitimately, what would be the ideal way for the world to end?                                  
                    <br><br>
                    I should also be a little more clear in what I mean. Although it would be fun to discuss the end of the 
                    human race, that’s too mainstream. When I mean the end of the world, I’m talking about the end of Earth and life 
                    on the planet as we know it.                   
                    <br><br>
                    <img class='leftImg' style='max-width: 10em; padding: .3em 1em .3em' 
                    src='../images/souljaworld.jpg' alt='Soulja Boy'>
                    What I find crazy about the question is that it’s not as crazy as it sounds. With the way global warming 
                    is going, it’s a definite future. At this point, I’m pretty sure we’ll find some way to live on the Moon or Mars 
                    before we stop abusing the planet to death.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, let’s imagine this was the chosen ideal scenario: the Earth is destroyed by global warming and humans 
                    escape to Mars. What does that make humans? We officially become planet destroyers. Does that mean Mars will meet 
                    the same fate, or would humans unlock the achievement of learning from past mistakes by that time? And if the very 
                    likely former occurs, how would humans be any different from a virus?
                    <br><br>
                    <img class='rightImg' style='max-width: 10em; padding: .3em 1em .3em' 
                    src='../images/san-fran.png' alt='San Fran'>
                    I would like to say I have faith in humanity for not becoming a literal parasite of the galaxy like so many sci-fi 
                    shows indicate, but I really think it’s a strong possibility. Although I hate to admit it, inherently, I agree with 
                    the old man <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Hobbes" target='_blank'>Thomas Hobbes</a>, people are inherently ‘bad’ and require civilization to 
                    exercise ‘good’. Need proof? I present: the spring coronavirus hoarders (and to some extent, the recent violent/damaging police protests). Case closed.
                    <br><br>
                    For real though, the definition of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ can be very complex and I realize that. It’s possible that 
                    the hoarder was actually someone trying to get supplies for their elderly family who really couldn’t go out during this 
                    major historical event. However, it’s difficult to justify the streets not turning into scenes from The Purge without 
                    the support of civilization and government assurance. Based on this, I don’t think we need movies or tv shows to let us 
                    know what post-apocalyptic humanity would look like.
                    <br><br>
                    So, if this were the case, would it be a good thing to let humanity live in an ideal ending of the Earth? Would life be 
                    better off if we saved something else instead, like perhaps populating Mars with forests or growth-oriented species? Maybe, 
                    by that point, we could create artificial intelligence to take care of those new populations to ensure we give nature another chance.
                    <br><br>
                    To be honest, either outcome is fine by me, what I’m concerned about are the dogs of the world. If they die along with the Earth, 
                    I will John Wick the universe.
