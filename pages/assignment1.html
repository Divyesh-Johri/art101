                <h3>Beam me up, Scotty</h3>                
                <p>
                    Welcome all to my first blog! For those of you wondering the kind of content this page could have, by 
                    the end, this post will give a good clue! 
                    <img class='leftImg' style='max-width: 10em; padding: .3em 1em .3em 0' 
                    src='../images/startrek.png' alt='Star Trek'>              
                    <br><br>Ok ok, so, imagine this. Teleportation has just been invented. It copies the form of                    
                    Star Trek, in which bodies are dematerialized and reconstructed through                    
                    <a href='https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a25699/how-quantum-teleportation-works/' target='_blank'>quantum entanglement</a>.
                    Basically, your body is copied, destroyed, and recreated at a molecular level in the location 
                    you wished to teleport to. How cool is that? I’m sure you’re very excited that some random blog 
                    on the internet has just told you teleportation exists with a page from Popular Mechanics as proof.
                    This is only theoretical, ok.                    
                    <br><br>But, while this sounds all sweet and amazing, there’s something that’s been in the back of 
                    my mind since it arrived in a conversation with a few of my friends. Is the teleported you actually 
                    you? I mean, think about it. Essentially, you are dying and being cloned. Your atoms are copied to the 
                    new location. Hell, even if your atoms are transported you are being dematerialized, so you’re still dying. 
                    So is the person that has just been recreated you or your clone that has the same memory and personality as you?
                    <br><br>This questions the theory behind the existence of a soul and the centuries-long argument 
                    of mind-body dualism. Do you believe that your body is purely physical? Is your mind, or soul, 
                    separate from the confines of your body? It’s something that’s been on my mind for a while, and 
                    I honestly can’t tell. You need your body to live. Your mind is physical, it’s real, it can be 
                    affected physically. What happens to it can change your personality and your thoughts. But how can 
                    I look at a clone and honestly say that it’s me? I’m not sure if I’m willing to say that when Scotty 
                    beams me up, I’m the one that’s traveling.</p>

                <h3>The End of the World</h3>                
                <p>
                    How would you want the world to end? I’m definitely not bringing this up because of mass panic over some 
                    disease that sounds like STUPID-19 (haha gottem). Legitimately, what would be the ideal way for the world to end?                                  
                    <br><br>
                    I should also be a little more clear in what I mean. Although it would be fun to discuss the end of the 
                    human race, that’s too mainstream. When I mean the end of the world, I’m talking about the end of Earth and life 
                    on the planet as we know it.                   
                    <br><br>
                    <img class='leftImg' style='max-width: 15em; padding: .3em 1em .3em 0' 
                    src='../images/souljaworld.jpg' alt='Soulja Boy'>
                    What I find crazy about the question is that it’s not as crazy as it sounds. With the way global warming 
                    is going, it’s a definite future. At this point, I’m pretty sure we’ll find some way to live on the Moon or Mars 
                    before we stop abusing the planet to death.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, let’s imagine this was the chosen ideal scenario: the Earth is destroyed by global warming and humans 
                    escape to Mars. What does that make humans? We officially become planet destroyers. Does that mean Mars will meet 
                    the same fate, or would humans unlock the achievement of learning from past mistakes by that time? And if the very 
                    likely former occurs, how would humans be any different from a virus?
                    <br><br>
                    <img class='rightImg' style='max-width: 15em; padding: .3em 0 .3em 1em' 
                    src='../images/san-fran.png' alt='San Fran'>
                    I would like to say I have faith in humanity for not becoming a literal parasite of the galaxy like so many sci-fi 
                    shows indicate, but I really think it’s a strong possibility. Although I hate to admit it, inherently, I agree with 
                    the old man <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Hobbes" target='_blank'>Thomas Hobbes</a>, people are inherently ‘bad’ and require civilization to 
                    exercise ‘good’. Need proof? I present: the spring coronavirus hoarders (and to some extent, the recent violent/damaging police protests). Case closed.
                    <br><br>
                    For real though, the definition of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ can be very complex and I realize that. It’s possible that 
                    the hoarder was actually someone trying to get supplies for their elderly family who really couldn’t go out during this 
                    major historical event. However, it’s difficult to justify the streets not turning into scenes from The Purge without 
                    the support of civilization and government assurance. Based on this, I don’t think we need movies or tv shows to let us 
                    know what post-apocalyptic humanity would look like.
                    <br><br>
                    So, if this were the case, would it be a good thing to let humanity live in an ideal ending of the Earth? Would life be 
                    better off if we saved something else instead, like perhaps populating Mars with forests or growth-oriented species? Maybe, 
                    by that point, we could create artificial intelligence to take care of those new populations to ensure we give nature another chance.
                    <br><br>
                    To be honest, either outcome is fine by me, what I’m concerned about are the dogs of the world. If they die along with the Earth, 
                    I will John Wick the universe.

                <h3>Crisis of Choice</h3>                
                <p>
                    Allow me to introduce two popular ethical guidelines that have been used since hundreds of years ago: 
                    <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/" target="_blank">Utilitarianism</a> and 
                    <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/" target="_blank">Deontology</a>. 
                    Utilitarianism is the philosophy focused on attaining the greatest happiness for the greatest number. 
                    It quantifies happiness and is an ethical math that focuses on maximizing the <i>ends</i> rather than the <i>means</i>.
                    Deontology focus on the opposite; it's the belief that the only good actions are ones that have “good will” and are chosen by a <i>categorical imperative</i>.                                  
                    <br><br>
                    The “good will” is one which acts without bias or self-consideration, meaning volunteering at a bake sale to build service hours 
                    or a resume would NOT qualify, but doing the same because you wish to help those who you’re fundraising for does. To aid in maintaining 
                    good will, the imperative is a will that you would want everyone else to have when put in your position.               
                    <br><br>
                    <img class='leftImg' style='max-width: 20em; padding: .3em 1em .3em 0' 
                    src='../images/cookie_dough.jpg' alt='Cookie Dough'>
                    For example, if you wanted to steal the cookie dough in Louie’s because you were out of meal points and you absolutely need cookie dough, 
                    you would think whether or not you’d want everyone else to steal cookie dough. If it breaks your heart to think that all the cookie dough 
                    may be stolen when you need it most, then you shouldn’t steal.
                    <br><br>
                    So to sum up what all of that means, Kant doesn’t really care about the outcomes of actions, what he cares about are the means, as opposed 
                    to Utilitarianism, which is focused on the ends, or attaining the greatest happiness.
                    <br><br>
                    If you were to help an old lady cross the road, but then get run over by some rad hoverboarder campus rebel, Kant would think your action 
                    was still correct since you had a good will. Utilitarians, on the other hand, would frown in disapproval as the outcome probably reduced the 
                    total happiness for the people involved.
                    <br><br>
                    <img class='rightImg' style='max-width: 20em; padding: .3em 0 .3em 1em' 
                    src='../images/porsche.jpg' alt='Porsche'>
                    Let’s take a more extreme example, you’re a crazy rich Asian with a Porsche zooming down Shortlidge like it’s a jet runway. Unfortunately, 
                    you see the pedestrian crosswalk has people in it, all with headphones in or something that makes them frustratingly oblivious to what’s 
                    happening. There’s no time to brake. Would you run over the group of people with suits and resumes probably headed to the career fair on one 
                    side, or the older couple with a dog on the other?
                    <br><br>
                    Tough.
                    <br><br>
                    A utilitarian would most likely go for the couple, just because of numbers. I don’t honestly know what a Kantian would do. Probably have a 
                    heart attack and die along with whoever else they hit.
                    <br><br>
                    Taking it down a notch, we all have faced scenarios in which our actions, though good in intention, end in bad results. Is it comforting to 
                    adopt Kant’s view that those actions were still good? Or is it instructive to follow Utilitarianism, which avoids such embarrassment? What 
                    do you value, the <i>ends</i> or the <i>means</i>? Choosing is tough. But it’s pretty cool that we <i>can</i> choose.

                <h3>Yo What's Up? Hey! Hello?</h3>                
                <p>
                    Because I miss Penn State so much, I'll talk about something I noticed last year as a freshman in Simmons Hall.
                    <br><br>
                    Before I headed to class, I always made sure to check the weather, bring what was appropriate, and take care of water-bottle refills or bathroom 
                    business. I then took the shortest route to class, speeding on cold or rainy days, though I prefered to stroll when it was nice out.                                  
                    <br><br>
                    For instance, my walk to the Sackett building for English. The walk from Simmons Hall was, in ideal situations, wonderful. I walked past Atherton, 
                    through the HUB Lawn where any special events were in full view. Then through the Old Main Lawn, where the bell tower stood in all its renovated glory 
                    ready to chime its disappointment at me when I was late.               
                    <br><br>
                    <img class='leftImg' style='max-width: 15em; padding: .3em 1em .3em 0' 
                    src='../images/airpods.jpg' alt='Airpods'>
                    Due to these wonderful sceneries, I rarely payed attention to the people who walked by me.  But one cloudy, uneventful day, I began observing some of the 
                    passerbys and noticed something strange.
                    <br><br>
                    More than half of them wore headphones.
                    <br><br>
                    I guess it shouldn’t have shocked me too hard. I remember the awkward moments where I would see someone I know walking down Pollock road and call out to them, 
                    only to have them pass me by without any reaction. They were always wearing headphones. Or when people behind me ask questions seemingly addressed to me, only 
                    for me to turn around and realize they’re speaking to their AirPods.
                    <br><br>
                    I didn’t see the need for headphones since my walks to class were typically 5-15 minutes. Even on hikes, I deemed headphones to be unnecessary as the natural 
                    environment more than makes up for it.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m not a boomer or whatever, so I won’t say “oh headphones are a risk for the youth that will destroy human civilization” or something. In fact, I think the 
                    convenience that these headphones bring is a great thing and reflects our advances in technology. However, I can’t help but think that we’re losing something 
                    by plugging our ears out to the environment around us.
                    <br><br>
                    Much of classical philosophy focuses on how to live a happy life, and human interaction (including 
                    <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/friendship/" target="_blank">friendship</a>, a hard-hitter in Aristotle’s 
                    <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.html" target="_blank">Nicomachean Ethics</a>) happens to be a pillar. Would blocking out our environment 
                    in the most trivial of cases like walking to class harm these important aspects of life?
                    <br><br>
                    I personally think there’s something wrong with walking around ears plugged for so long, especially when it’s only for 5 minutes. I suggest, after COVID is gone,
                    that you try to walk down Pollock and take notice of just how many headphone users are out there.

                <h3>Tipping Points</h3>                
                <p>
                    I love tipping point stories. We’re living in one right now. Someone decided to indulge in some bat soup, and the world quickly plunged into chaos. 
                    Nearly all the fads, trends, or changes that have been sparked in today’s world come from a shift of stagnation to commotion after what’s known as a “tipping point”.
                    <br><br>
                    <a href="https://www.gladwellbooks.com/titles/malcolm-gladwell/the-tipping-point/9780316316965/" target="_blank"><i>The Tipping Point</i></a> is a book I really liked from some 
                    really smart sociology dude named 
                    <a href="https://www.gladwellbooks.com/landing-page/about-malcolm-gladwell/" target="_blank">Malcolm Gladwell</a> goes into great detail about this phenomenon. 
                    In it, he not only describes what tipping points are, but also provides tips for controlling and creating tipping points using numerous examples ranging from brand 
                    popularity to crime to school shooting.

                    Overall, his message was that you didn’t need to do anything big to start a movement. That’s what makes tipping points “tipping points”. A small change in how you 
                    present something, who you present it to, who presents it, or what you present could drastically increase its effect.               
                    <br><br>

                    I’ll take a popular example from <i>The Tipping Point</i> to illustrate it for you. Consider the 
                    <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-city-used-to-be-a-terrifying-place-photos-2013-7#movies-like-death-wish-1974-taxi-driver-1976-and-escape-from-new-york-1981--pictured-chronicled-the-decline-of-new-york-city-in-pop-culture-20"
                    target="_blank">insane crime rates and disastrous environment of New York City during the ’70s and ’80s</a>. Murders, drugs, rape, theft, the whole shebang 
                    (I won’t delete that word but I hate that I wrote it). NYC was absolute chaos, a breeding ground for delinquency and the reason why hundreds of superhero 
                    comics are centered on or gain inspiration from the city of dreams.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, take a look at the murder rate chart, which was in the article I linked before. Notice that in the ’90s, all of that just disappears. It would be nice to 
                    think it was the work of a law enforcement overhaul or increasing popularity of Spiderman comics but no. It’s actually the work of arresting people who pee on walls, 
                    stopping fare-dodgers from jumping on subways, and cleaning graffiti.
                    <br><br>
                    <img class='rightImg' style='max-width: 20em; padding: .3em 0 .3em 1em' 
                    src='../images/hardline.jpg' alt='Battlefield Hardline'>
                    Yeah, no need for a superhero to beat up super-powered gang bosses. No need for a criminal/police warzone like that depicted in Battlefield Hardline (which SUCKED by 
                    the way, complete flop of a game with next to no weapon variety). All that was needed was a few small changes to the environment that made people more apprehensive to 
                    commit common crimes. That rolled into a change in public opinion/thought, which translated into a lot less crime.
                    <br><br>
                    This is typically known as the “Broken Windows Theory”, which proposes utilizing changes in an environment to spark ideological change. And while there are people who 
                    find fault to this explanation of NYC’s crime drop, it’s still without a doubt as much of a tipping point as bat soup causing Penn State to screw over countless students’ 
                    study abroad and senior year experiences.

                <h3>I {> Robot</h3>                
                <p>
                    Can you imagine being friends with a robot?
                    <br><br>
                    It’s something that is taken for granted in numerous movies and television shows, but it’s something I’ve always wondered since I got my first Alexa.                             
                    <br><br>
                    <img class='leftImg' style='max-width: 15em; padding: .3em 1em .3em 0' 
                    src='../images/alexa.jpg' alt='Alexa Echo'>
                    Currently, Alexa rests above my desk and is set to play the Pina Colada song when I enter the room, except, it’s been disconnected from the wifi so now it sits there 
                    unused. I guess part of the reason why I don’t use it is that there’s nothing much I need it for.              
                    <br><br>
                    Alexa would be most useful for controlling a smart home. Her news features are also okay, but not very detailed. Talking to her is much less interesting than talking 
                    to my roommate. I could play music, but I don’t have Spotify Premium and Amazon Music is ‘ehhh’ at best so that’s out of the picture.
                    <br><br>
                    Ultimately, the next step for devices like Alexa or Google Home is sentient interaction, meaning, an AI assistant that behaves like a living one. But that brings me 
                    back to my point, can you truly be friends with an AI robot?
                    <br><br>                    
                    Friends, according to many wise ancient dudes like Aristotle and Plato, are formed by mutual respect of certain virtues, as well as by tribulations faced and time spent 
                    together. This makes sense, since we tend to be closer to those whos virtues (like loyalty, modesty, sincerity) are admirable and those who have spent time and been 
                    through challenges with us.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, can a robot be capable of meeting these same conditions?
                    <br><br>
                    <img class='rightImg' style='max-width: 10em; padding: .3em 0 .3em 1em' 
                    src='../images/c3po.jpg' alt='C3PO'>
                    Let’s first imagine a sentient being like C3PO. I think a truly sentient being like him is capable of the conditions for friendship, as he is able to admire and dislike 
                    virtues as well as choose to undertake challenges and spend time with whomever he wants.
                    <br><br>
                    Now let’s look at Alexa. She is a supervised AI with fixed responses to certain user prompts, meaning if you ask Alexa whether she likes cats or dogs, she responds with 
                    “I like both cats and dogs, but I’m really more of a narwhal person” every time. C3PO would never. I do not think an AI like her is one that can reflect a mutual 
                    admiration for each other’s virtues. Saying she has virtues is in itself a stretch.
                    <br><br>
                    I say this, but there are actually a lot of people who truly love AIs. Look at this dude at the left. He married a hologram of an anime character. It’s literally no 
                    different than Alexa. He loves it. There are many videos my philosophy professor put us through to prove this, 
                    <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/28/health/rise-of-digisexuals-intl/index.html" target="_blank">I recommend you don’t watch them</a>. And he recognizes the hologram 
                    to be a robot but says he loves it like a real woman. How is this possible?
                    <br><br>
                    It goes without saying that if you love a robot you could be friends with it right? Is it the idea of the relationship being unconditional and unrejected? Is that even 
                    a relationship? These questions are too complex for a blog post, but someday when C3POs start walking around this topic will become the forefront of public debate and AI ethics.

                    Speaking of Batman, how many of you guys watched the Dark Knight? Actually, you really don’t need to have, it’s probably a given that the Joker is Batman’s greatest foe of 
                    all time, maybe even the greatest comic villain in general. And it’s the one reason why Batman shines as a 
                    <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/" target="_blank">Kantian philosopher</a>. Pshhhhhhh I can hear your expectations for a fun read on Batman deflate 
                    like a leaking airbag. Don’t worry, I won’t be “so serious” about this one. Though you might be at the end.                         
                    <br><br>                    
                    Batman has <i>categorical imperatives</i> that he follows, a line in the sand if you will, for what he believes in as ethically right, not just for himself but for anyone in his position. 
                    Killing crosses his line, so he never does it, even against a formidable psychopath murderer like the Joker, who really has no saving grace for anyone but the readers. What if Batman 
                    killed the Joker from the start? All the people that the Joker kills throughout his criminal career, including those close to Batman, could be saved, although it would have crossed 
                    Batman’s moral code. This conundrum falls under something known as 
                    <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/" target="_blank">Utilitarianism</a>, an ethical philosophy that emphasizes the ‘greatest amount of good for the greatest 
                    number of people'.           
                    <br><br>
                    <img class='rightImg' style='max-width: 15em; padding: .3em 0 .3em 1em' 
                    src='../images/alcohol.png' alt='Drinks'>
                    Suppose, you and your friends are at a party, and your friends take a tad too much to drink and are really in no shape to pull an all-night rager, except for you, who has been managing to 
                    have one legally-defined standard drink per hour, just like the Penn State Safe and Aware modules told you to. Now, you need to decide whether it’s a better idea to get your friends home 
                    to bed or to keep the party going. As a utilitarian, and as a decent friend, you may think it normal to bring your friends home, even if it cuts the fun short for you. But let’s consider 
                    something more serious.
                    <br><br>
                    What if you and your friends were caught with alcohol in your <i>friend’s</i> dorm? But, due to the wrath of God and some karma, you were the one who brought the drink and the only one holding it. 
                    Now, everyone would be cited for being in the presence of alcohol, but whether everyone gets cited for drinking is up to you. Do you take one for the team and solely accept the consequences 
                    of drinking and bringing drinks to the room? Or do you involve everyone else in the room during your hearing with the Office of Integrity (or whoever handles the issue), and partially shift 
                    the blame off yourself? This decision is harder, in both cases you are blamed, but it’s a matter of severity. Utilitarianism says you should take full blame and responsibility, to maximize 
                    the overall happiness amongst the group.
                    <br><br>                    
                    But what do you think is right? Are you ok with sacrificing yourself to save others? What if this incident involved <i>your friend</i>. Would you be okay with them taking full responsibility? 
                    I wonder what Batman would do?

                <p>
                    Halloween is here!!! Spooky season is one of my favorites, even though I can’t quite celebrate it like I used to. My lightsaber is propped on the shelf above my bed, and orange pumpkin 
                    lights glow across my window every night. 
                    <br><br>
                    <img class='leftImg' style='max-width: 15em; padding: .3em 1em .3em 0' 
                    src='../images/pumpkin_lights.jpg' alt='Pumpkin Lights'>
                    Every time I look at it, I’m filled with memories of trick-or-treating: the fun of dressing up as an elven warrior, a Hogwarts wizard, or a Jedi of the Old Republic, the thrill of 
                    exploring neighborhoods far from home with friends, the decorations of ghouls and graves and the few houses that went ALL out. The rush of adrenaline as we took a few extra candies 
                    than we were told to by the paper signs taped on the unattended bowls.                      
                    <br><br>                    
                    The heavy burden of a good night’s haul. The sweet kiss of crisp, October night air cutting through our costumes. The great trade war that ensued after as we debate on how many 
                    Snickers a Twix bar was worth. Such memories are hard to forget.         
                    <br><br>                    
                    Yet as I think about them, I wonder why we decided that a day that was meant to precede a ceremony to respect the dead turned into a night for kids in transformers costumes to snack 
                    on Skittles. According to extensive research consisting of a 
                    <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/halloween/history-of-halloween" target="_blank">History.com</a> article, by the twentieth century, the mostly religious roots Halloween was 
                    associated with (All Saints’ Day, All Souls’ Day) turned into a community-focused festivity, as “frightening” and “grotesque” elements were discouraged.
                    <br><br>
                    But Halloween today very much celebrates these “frightening” aspects. The ghostly, after-death nature of the celebration has remolded itself into the holiday. Though as seen in the 
                    numerous Halloween movies, variety of costumes, and craze of haunted houses, these once religious, serious aspects have turned into a commercial commodity — entertainment.
                    <br><br>  
                    <img class='rightImg' style='max-width: 15em; padding: .3em 0 .3em 1em' 
                    src='../images/ghosts.png' alt='Ghosts'>                  
                    With the growing age of science and atheism, do we now see ghosts and souls as merely a means of entertainment? The same souls that we may pray to and visit when their birthdays or 
                    days of death approach, do we really discount them as “spooky ghosts” on Halloween?
                    <br><br>                    
                    I think the idea that Halloween has shifted towards cosplays of movie characters and carvings of pumpkin heads has turned our image of ghouls and ghosts as just characters in pop culture, 
                    rather than the human souls they once represented.
                    <br><br>
                    The thought of ghosts has turned into some supernatural craze for people to fawn over as they excite themselves over weird bright spots in photographs. Yet these same people will 
                    view the ghosts as freaks of nature, and talk about exorcising them as if they were dangerous animals rather than once living people.
                    <br><br>
                    If I were to dress up as a normal person, few would probably hand me candy, retorting on my lackluster efforts. Even though it’s really these dead “normal people” that we dress up 
                    as and celebrate every year. Should Halloween remain as an entertaining, cultural festivity? Or is it a disservice to those who Halloween represents? Anything’s fine by me as 
                    long as I get my share of Reese’s.

                <h3>All I Want for Christmas… is a $50 Amazon Gift Card!!!</h3>                
                <p>
                    It was just Halloween, but I guess now it’s Christmas. All anyone talks about from November 1st till the day of reckoning is Christmas. I check on Instagram, boom, Mariah Carey 
                    blasts out of some meme page’s post. I go to Starbucks for a drink, bam, the menus are red and peppermint mochas whir in their machines.
                    <br><br>                    
                    Although I am Hindu, my family and I still celebrate Christmas, on a cultural level. We assemble a tree, hang red and white lights, and decorate it with old crafts, ornaments, 
                    and the classic star. My sister and I would always go to bed nervous for the next day, wondering whether we’ve been good enough for a new iPhone or perhaps a new game console (at least I did).                    
                    <br><br>                    
                    <img class='leftImg' style='max-width: 15em; padding: .3em 1em .3em 0' 
                    src='../images/christmas_tree.png' alt='Christmas Tree'>
                    I remember one Christmas, my sister and I woke up and met to go down our stairs together, to reach the living room and view what Santa had brought us. We rushed over, and as we approached 
                    the base of the tree, we were confused. There was nothing there.        
                    <br><br>                    
                    After throwing a fit and marching back up the stairs to our parents’ bedroom to notify them of this tragedy, we were given our presents. A $50 Visa gift card. Before then, we were never 
                    given a gift card as a present before, and it was a shock. My sister straight up cried.
                    <br><br>
                    It disappointed me at first, but after I thought about it, I realized it was the best form of gift possible. The ability to buy whatever I want, so that there was no confusion as to what 
                    I’d wish for. Even though I did make a wishlist, but whatever.
                    <br><br>                                    
                    Yet there was something honestly more exciting about receiving a physical gift. The delight, perhaps the surprise, of the item you’ve wished for in your hands, rather than a card that could 
                    provide access to said object. The joy of the person giving the gift as they’re relieved to see the reaction they hoped for.
                    <br><br>                    
                    It’s often said that the internet has dehumanized many aspects of our lives, turning people into profiles, interactions into text messages, cash into cards and Venmo; I don’t even need to 
                    link you to an external article for that fact. Similarly, the in-real-life gifts we provide during Christmas, birthdays, or other holidays are becoming tokens known as gift cards, 
                    or straight-up cash.
                    <br><br>
                    The thought and effort that was typically involved with gifts are gone, what we define as ‘gifts’ are now just virtual bags of money, either specialized for a certain service or store, 
                    or representations of literal dollar amounts. And practically, it’s better this way, why should people have to go through the trouble of purchasing gifts that might get regifted or 
                    returned? It makes sense to me.
                    <br><br>

                    But then I think about that Christmas day. My sister wallowing in tears, not because she didn’t receive a gift, but because her dreams of waking up to a new nail polish set were replaced 
                    by some silver plastic card that wasn’t even under the tree. It’s not that gift cards are bad gifts, they just aren’t as personal as physical products, aren’t as exciting or thrilling 
                    as tearing the candy cane wrap and uncovering a Wii or an Xbox.
                    <br><br>
                    The act of giving isn’t so much about what’s given then it is the thoughts and feelings of the person who gives it. Today, in a time in which feelings are easier to mask behind text 
                    or tweet as political statements or arguments, the act of giving has become a result-oriented procedure in which the convenience of a plastic ticket for a free dinner from Applebees 
                    has replaced the meaningful gesture of a wrapped bundle of thoughtful effort.
                    <br><br>
                    Though for future reference, I’m more of a Chile’s kind of guy, you really can’t beat their bottomless tortilla chips.

                    I want to ask, what kind of a person do you think you are? Or rather, what kind of a person do you commonly present yourself as? Subconsciously, we all modify our personalities or appearances 
                    depending on our environment. Maybe this is kind of related to the broken windows theory I mentioned before, to be honest I don’t know what specific philosophies preach this way of thought.
                    <br><br>                    
                    Fortunately, it isn't necessary for anyone to know the thoughts of old dead people to philosophize.                   
                    <br><br>

                    The universal piece of advice that is now a theme in every kid’s show in existence is to “be yourself”. Don’t let others determine who you are, and never give up what you truly want to do, 
                    admirable thoughts. Unfortunately, our lives are not movies or cartoons where we have a writer laying out the plot to a perfect happy ending (unless you believe in such a fatalistic God). 
                    We naturally change ourselves in front of different people, and we naturally look for gratification by approval from others.        
                    <br><br>                    
                    This doesn’t necessarily mean we aren’t being ourselves. Choosing to change our attitudes in different environments or with different people is something only we could do. Only we know how 
                    we want to act. But that also leads to a circular argument, so I’ll leave that decision to you.
                    <br><br>
                    “Masks” are probably the best way to describe our changes in personality or appearance due to environmental changes. We have numerous masks that make up who we are. Whether we have a “mask-less” 
                    personality is also something I’ll leave to you to think about.
                    <br><br>
                    <img class='rightImg' style='max-width: 15em; padding: .3em 0 .3em 1em' 
                    src='../images/three_faces.jpg' alt='Three Faces'>                                    
                    For example’s sake, I’ll briefly describe a few masks that I tend to wear. In an unknown environment, where there are people I’m not familiar with, I tend to be a lot more reserved. I don’t speak 
                    with people unless I need to or unless they have a conversation that piques my interest. Perhaps the same could be said even when there are people I know (though naturally, I would be a little 
                    more conversational).
                    <br><br>                    
                    In a known environment, perhaps a friend’s house, I tend to be much more open than normal. It’s a little odd trying to describe it now that I’m trying to, but basically, I tend to add more 
                    humor or sarcasm to what I say. Jokes get more offensive, casual compliments or roasts are easier to give, and it’s much easier to speak my mind.
                    <br><br>
                    I believe that those two masks, on a broad scale, are very similar for people who are introverted. Of course, there are probably many more for many different environments, but I think you 
                    get the idea. I think that the more aware we become of our own masks, the easier it is to empathize with others. If we can understand the fact that people’s personalities aren’t stagnant 
                    and that the qualities you notice in someone are part of the mask they choose to carry in that moment, the easier it is for us to drop quick judgments and understand the actions of others.

                <h3>Parent Problems</h3>                
                <p>
                    Fall break is approaching and I am exhausted. I have been dragging myself through the past few weeks, and now that it’s so close every minute that passes by seems too far away.
                    <br><br>                    
                    I remember going back home during the breaks last year when COVID wasn't a thing. While it was relaxing and meeting high school friends was fun, it was also a very strange feeling. 
                    In high school, even when I turned 18, I never really considered myself an adult. When I came back from living on my own and “adulting” through problems and situations in college, 
                    I felt very different.                  
                    <br><br>                    
                    <img class='leftImg' style='max-width: 15em; padding: .3em 1em .3em 0' 
                    src='../images/family.png' alt='Family'>
                    But out of all the things about home that felt off, my relationship with my parents was the strangest. I can’t quite place it. In high school, I respected my parents as authority 
                    (though I frequently rebelled) and always changed my tone/attitude when I was around them. When I went back home, I didn't really know how to act around them. I didn't know if I should talk 
                    to them as a fellow adult or as a teenage son.
                    <br><br>                    
                    Not to say it’s bad in any way, or it became awkward to be with them. But it's a feeling in the back of my mind that hasn't resolved itself even now.
                    <br><br>
                    And it doesn’t just stop at my parents, my relationship with my little sister also feels off. I don’t feel like my attitude towards her has changed, though sometimes I think I have more 
                    of an obligation to help her with her issues. Also, her attitude with me has noticeably shifted. It’s almost like she regards my advice or actions more highly, like some form of 
                    respect (although maybe I’m dreaming it too).
                    <br><br>
                    <img class='rightImg' style='max-width: 20em; padding: .3em 0 .3em 1em' 
                    src='../images/family2.jpg' alt='Another Family'>                                    
                    I guess my underlying question is, how do we define our relationship with our family and how does that change with separation? I know some of my friends treat their family like friends, 
                    where no filter in language is necessary and they even reach the stage of sharing offensive memes on Instagram. But then, there are others who always follow the decisions their parents 
                    make, and keep an overly sophisticated tone when talking with them.
                    <br><br>                    
                    Many theorist big wigs say it’s impossible for parents to be friends, since unlike your friends, your parents aren’t people you choose to have a relationship with. But I don’t know, I 
                    feel like the bonds between family are too complex to describe as friends or not friends. “Unconditional love” is a good way to put it, but even that’s not enough to fully explain it.
                    <br><br>
                    I guess from an objective point of view, my family are the people who fill my meal points even when I spend it all on Panda and cookie dough, a spot not even my friends can claim.
