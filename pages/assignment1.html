                <h3>Beam me up, Scotty</h3>                
                <p>Welcome all to my first blog! For those of you wondering the kind of content this page could have, by 
                    the end, this post will give a good clue!                    
                    <br><br>Ok ok, so, imagine this. Teleportation has just been invented. It copies the form of                    
                    Star Trek, in which bodies are dematerialized and reconstructed through                    
                    <a href='https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a25699/how-quantum-teleportation-works/' target='_blank'>quantum entanglement</a>. 
                    <img class='abstractImg' style='max-width: 20%; height: auto; padding: 1em 1em' 
                    src='../images/startrek.png' alt='Star Trek'>
                    Basically, your body is copied, destroyed, and recreated at a molecular level in the location 
                    you wished to teleport to. How cool is that? I’m sure you’re very excited that some random blog 
                    on the internet has just told you teleportation exists with a page from Popular Mechanics as proof.
                    This is only theoretical, ok.                    
                    <br><br>But, while this sounds all sweet and amazing, there’s something that’s been in the back of 
                    my mind since it arrived in a conversation with a few of my friends. Is the teleported you actually 
                    you? I mean, think about it. Essentially, you are dying and being cloned. Your atoms are copied to the 
                    new location. Hell, even if your atoms are transported you are being dematerialized, so you’re still dying. 
                    So is the person that has just been recreated you or your clone that has the same memory and personality as you?
                    <br><br>This questions the theory behind the existence of a soul and the centuries-long argument 
                    of mind-body dualism. Do you believe that your body is purely physical? Is your mind, or soul, 
                    separate from the confines of your body? It’s something that’s been on my mind for a while, and 
                    I honestly can’t tell. You need your body to live. Your mind is physical, it’s real, it can be 
                    affected physically. What happens to it can change your personality and your thoughts. But how can 
                    I look at a clone and honestly say that it’s me? I’m not sure if I’m willing to say that when Scotty 
                    beams me up, I’m the one that’s traveling.</p>
